## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
 Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an approach to creating software applications that takes advantage of reusable components or services, it is also a software design pattern which makes two or more system or applications to talk each other 

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA 

Standardized Service Contracts - it is a software design principle applied within the service oriented design paradigm to ensure that contracts within a service inventory and the standardized service contracts also serve their contracts like express their purpose, their capabilities to ensure that the contract will do or must be done

Loose Coupling - it is a software design principle that give implementation while still guaranteeing baseline compatibility fir ysers who have grown or rely on the service features

Abstraction - Abstraction allows enterprise to define technology in the context of a business process and also abstraction breaks the dependencies and introduces agility.

Reusability - in its own word reusability, it can look for existing service before creating new ones or look for reuse before creating new services

Autonomy - Consumers need the defined service contract engagement so the users can then consume or in simple words it is a freedom and control to make its own decisions without the need for approval or involvement

Statelessness - it is a service minimization of resource consumption or simply the information shortened but still complete


Discoverability - it is a metadata for discovery which also communicate purpose and capabilities to human, The system must communicate on the consumer and offer as much as detail as possible.

Composability - It breaks the big problem to small problem, It helps us to solve problem into manageable parts

Interoperability - Services sets standards that allow subscribers to use the servicee and architecture ensure that services dont get reduced and interoperability referers to the sharing of data, The more software programs are, the easier for them to exchange data

3.Define Microservices

Microservices is also like SOA but Microservices is used to build individual applications in a way that makes them more scalable and resilient, in simple words it is like multiple pieces of lego or blocks that if you put together it build different structures, microservices are small, independent components that if you combine it will build larger applications

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices 

Independently deployable- it is the most important characteristics of microservices, it is independently deployable becuase the services are smaller they communicate with each other via networks and as architecture choice offer many option for solving the problems you may face.

Right tool for job - It is one of the benefits of using microservice, microservices is the right tool for the job by making easier to deploy more data because it can be small pieces but complete data and each service can use its own language and framework for you to communicate easily with your application of choice

Precise Scaling - with microservices, individual services can be individually deployed and from its word precise scaling it gives accuracy of expression or the exactness of service, it can not only handle a large number of tasks at the same time but it can handle them efficiently and exactly

5.List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Mircoservices

Similarities
Reuse - The SOA will look for existing service before creating new ones or look for reuse before creating new services. The Microservice prefer to reuse code by copy and accept data duplication.

Synchronous calls - The SOA service are available throughout enterprise via synchronous protocols while Microservices use synchronous calls will create real time dependencies or when one service sends a request to another service and wait for the response before proceeding futther

Data duplication - They both collections that focus on performing specific function, they are also the same in terms of maintaining complex data synchronization patterns

Differences between SOA and Microservices

Communication - The SOA communication is handled by ESB according to the handout and it can become a single point of failure for the whole enterprise because it only provides the medium by which services "talk" to each other and if a single service slows down the entrie system can be affecte, While the Microservice developed independently with its own communication protocol and relies on simpler messaging system like APIs which enable quicker communication

Interoperability - in SOA Services sets standards that allow subscribers to use the servicee and architecture ensure that services dont get reduced and interoperability referers to the sharing of data, The more software programs are, the easier for them to exchange data
while in Microservices are capable of two or more information system or components that allow exchanging and use of information across systems

Service granularity - The Microservice has highly specialized services but it is designed to do one thing while the SOA service can only range from small but specialized service to enterprise with wide services

Speed - SOA is simplify development and troubleshooting and because of that this also tends to make SOA operate more slowly than microservice and also because microservice allow developers to work on small independent pieces of an application so it can quickly deloyed and tested without affection the rest of the application.
